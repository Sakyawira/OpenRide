A ride-sharing app that is free for everyone, forever.

This app aims to provide a no-fee alternative to apps like Uber, Grab, Gojek, and Didi. We're here solely because we want drivers to have a better quality of life—and riders to save a few bucks.

## Why should drivers use OpenRide?

OpenRide offers numerous benefits for drivers:

- **Lower Fees**: Ride-sharing apps like Uber, Grab, or Gojek take an average of 40% from what the customer pays for each ride. In contrast, OpenRide doesn't take any cuts—what the customer pays is what goes into your pocket!

- **Brand Agnostic**: OpenRide doesn’t see itself as a company; we're a community. We’ll never require you to wear OpenRide-branded helmets or jackets (but please do wear *a* helmet!).

- **Community Driven**: Unlike big tech companies, we're not here to take a margin from you. Every feature we push is solely to enhance the experience for drivers and riders. We prioritise features like driver safety over making our own eMoney :D So please do tell us what you want us to develop next!

- **No Bait and Switch**: OpenRide is not a startup—it has no investors, and therefore no deadlines for when we need to start making money. Whatever benefits we offer you now (lower fees, etc.) will never change once our marketing budget runs out—in fact, we don’t even have one.

## Why should riders use OpenRide?

OpenRide offers numerous benefits for riders:

- **Save Money**: Ride-sharing apps like Uber, Grab, or Gojek calculate the cost of each ride based on estimated cost of operation for the driver, the driver's margin, and the margin the companies themselves take. OpenRide does the first two—we don’t take any cuts. That way, a ride that usually costs $10 might only cost you $8. That's a 20% savings on every ride! No coupon code needed!

- **Privacy**: Collecting user data for advertising is considered standard practice for tech giants, but with the frequent data leaks, issues like identity theft can end up costing you. OpenRide only collects the data needed to run its ride-sharing capabilities—and we will never sell your data! Don’t just take our word for it; you can check what our apps do behind the scenes since it’s:

- **Open Source**: All the code running our services is available on GitHub. Open-source software has a lot of benefits—it means any software engineer can inspect and fix bugs or security issues that may arise. The visibility and progress of these fixes will also be transparent to everyone on our issues channel.

- **Same Rules Forever**: If this sounds too good to be true, rest assured, our GNU GPLv3 license guarantees that OpenRide will always be free. And if the worst happens and we get shut down or bought out (very unlikely), the code is still here, and anyone is free to copy it and pick up the mantle. The license ensures that any piece of OpenRide code published under it will always be free for everyone, forever.

## FAQ

### Where is the download link?

As you can see, there’s still no code in this repository—we’ve only just started development. Please don’t expect everything to work perfectly in our first release; in fact, our initial release will likely only include the frontend, with no way to actually connect drivers and riders.

But rest assured, we'll keep you updated with every step of our progress. We hope you’ll join us on this ride.

### Can I support OpenRide in any way?

Yes. The best way to support us is to use the app and encourage others to do so. Our peer-to-peer network relies on the physical proximity of one user to the next. The more users there are, the better our connections will be.

### Is it safe?

Overall, yes. We're very careful to ensure that the peer-to-peer nature of the app doesn’t compromise your privacy and security. For example, the app implements end-to-end encryption for all your data. Safety is our priority. If you encounter any problems, you can create an [issue](https://github.com/Sakyawira/OpenRide/issues).

### Wait, you said that other ride-sharing apps take a 40% cut—how come riders are only saving 20% if you truly take no fee?

Good catch. The other 20% is a pay raise for the hardworking drivers!

### But seriously, what is your business model?

OpenRide is developed by what we like to think of as idealistic software engineers and designers. We're writing code for this in our free time while holding down day jobs.

One day, we might consider selling merch or running workshops on writing great software—but anything we do to earn money will never be connected to the ride-sharing app itself. That, we assure you, will never be a commercial product.
